HackerChat is a real-time hackable collaboration platform for developers. It's the next-gen hybrid between IRC, Instant Messenger, Google Docs, and BaseCamp. 1st place winner of the PilotPhilly 2013 hackathon.

Feel free to submit your pull requests if you come up with a clever way to add functionality to HackerChat. From /pony commands to a list of online users - you name it! ;)

### A note on using this

During the hackathon, the database URI and cookie session secret were shamelessly hardcoded into app.coffee.
This was fine because the repository was private. Now that this repo is public, those credentials live in a
module called `secrets.coffee` within the main repository root. If you want to actually run this thing locally, you'll need to create that
file and fill it out with the relevant data. It looks something like this:

    module.exports =
      MONGO_URI = "mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]"
      COOKIE_SECRET = "hack the planet etc"

By the way, those hardcoded credentials were **not** removed from the commit log. The passwords were changed though, naturally. (But nice try!)

### Deployment

Heroku: Just add a remote and (force) push your changes. Simple as that!

OpenShift: Just add a remote and (force) push your changes. Simple as that!

AutoDeploy: Enable WebSockets, add a remote and push your changes. Simple as that!

### Local Installation Guide

1. Clone or download .zip and extract this repository
2. Install node.js from [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)
3. Open up Terminal/Command Prompt and type in `npm install coffee-script -g` (you may want to sudo on unix-based OSes)
4. Sign up for an account on MongoLab and create a database at [https://mongolab.com](https://mongolab.com)
5. Create a file named `secrets.coffee` (see above), fill in your database location and credentials, and place it in the repository root.
6. Run `coffee app.coffee` in Terminal/Command Prompt
7. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:300) in your browser
8. Ba-de-dum! You got it up and running!

# User Guide

### Index View

The welcome page authenticates you using a name and a simple button.

### Chats View

Once you put in your name, you're brought to a screen that lists _only_ the rooms you created, and gives you an option to either join an existing room, create a new room, or log out.

If a user has created a room:

Else if a user has NOT created a room:

### Chat View

If you choose to create a room, a random hash will be generated, and this is what an empty room looks like. You can share the room using the 3 sharing icons or by copying the URL. The room will be private to only those you choose to share the link with.

### Chat Features

From there, other users can join your chat, and even modify the chat title in real-time. HTML formatting is supported...

Typing in `wget example.com` will bring up a sandboxed iframe of example.com. For example...

Typing in `xkcd 10` will bring up an image the 10th issue of xkcd. For example...

This is where the chat gets cooler: you can type in `<hack>` in the message bar and you'll gain access to a modal that will allow you to add functionality to the chat! Just click `Propagate Hack` and your hack will be carried out across all of your users.

For example, you can have a hack that adds some simple javascript output (like math) functionality:

### Mobile

Last but not least, HackerChat is compatible across all modern browsers and devices, including an optimized version for mobile. This is what a chat room looks like on an iPhone 5, and if you resize your browser window's width AND height, you'll see what I mean!
